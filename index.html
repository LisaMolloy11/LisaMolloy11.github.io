        <p>
            Hello my name is Lisa Molloy and welcome to my webpage. 
            Some interesting facts about me include that I am a vegetarian , 
            I am a huge Star Wars fan and 
            I have a dog named Riley.
            I love photography and traveling and have lived in Canada for two years. The photo to the left is one I took of Elbows Falls 
            in Alberta. 
            Iceland and Scotland are the next places I would love to travel to.

            My Background
        </h2>
        <p>My background includes Animal Care and IT. I studied Animal Care and I have worked at a doggie daycare and an animal shelter before. 
            During the pandemic I began my journey with coding
            beginning with a few workshops in block coding and app making. I really ejoyed them
            and so I completed my first short course in very basic HTML coding.
            Most recenlty I have completed a course in Tech which included 
            the basics of software development, data security and networking.

            This is my dog Riley. He is Bichon Frise that I rescued seven years ago
            when he was five years old. He loves to sleep, go for walks and eat
            treats. At Halloween I like to dress him up in costumes for a quick photo. Here he is dressed as 
            Alan Grant from Jurassic Park in the photo to the right.
